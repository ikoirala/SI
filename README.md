# deepSI (Modified)

Dynamical System Identification using Python, incorporating powerful deep learning methods. This version is based on the work by Gerben Beintema, with specific modifications to support version 3.13 for compatibility with specific dependencies.

## Goals of deepSI

The aim of deepSI is to provide a comprehensive platform for developing and applying (deep) dynamical system identification methods. Itâ€™s designed to be accessible, requiring minimal prior knowledge in system identification or machine learning, and often requires only a few lines of code.

## Installation

To install this specific version of deepSI with necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

```bash
conda install -c anaconda git
pip install git+https://github.com/ikoirala/SI@main
```

## Documentation
